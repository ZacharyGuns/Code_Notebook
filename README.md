Code_Notebook serves two purposes for me. First, as a way to review and practice the skills I was taught from the web development bootcamp I attended. And second, as a tool I can use to review these skills in the future should I forget how to do something. My goal is to expand on each language and tool listed here as much as possible, to do as many things in each one as I can so it can become a template for me to copy and paste from later. Anything that is possible in Javascript, I want to have an example of here. As much information as I can pull from APIs and store in databases I want to have here. Every bell and whistle I am able to successfully create an example of here provides good practice for me now and examples I can use for future projects later.
